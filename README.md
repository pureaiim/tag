Hello, this plugin will add a command onto your minecraft server.
Once you do '/tag [player]'. This will either tag yourself and force a mob within a certain radius to come after you or if you've specified a player, it'll look for a mob within the radius of them and chase them!

Commands:
  /tag [Player] - Tag yourself or another player!
Permissions:
  tag.self:
  tag.others:

Once you've been tagged by your tagger that has a name of 'TAGGER'. It will tag you and cause you to explode within 5 seconds!
^^ Just for fun! ^^
